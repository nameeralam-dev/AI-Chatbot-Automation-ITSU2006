IT Project Management Assessment 3: Project Management Plan

In todayâ€™s digital world, many companies face challenges in managing large volumes of customer queries quickly and efficiently. Traditional customer service teams often struggle with delays, repetitive questions, and limited availability outside business hours. To solve this problem, our project focuses on developing an AI powered chatbot that can automatically respond to customer support requests in real time.

This chatbot will be designed to handle at least 70 to 80% of common customer questions without human help, reducing response time from several minutes to a few seconds. The system will be connected to existing knowledge bases such as FAQs, Zendesk, or SharePoint, allowing it to give accurate and up to date answers. When the chatbot cannot resolve an issue, it will escalate the case to a human agent to ensure smooth communication and customer satisfaction.
